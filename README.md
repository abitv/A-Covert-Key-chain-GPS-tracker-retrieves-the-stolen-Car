A Covert Key chain GPS tracker retrieves the stolen Car
Opportunistic theft is one of the most common car thefts that occurs when a parked car is stolen when it is unoccupied and the keys are still in the ignition or nearby. Although it is one of the most frequent types of auto theft, it is also one of the most avoidable. There are many cases of car theft that happened only because of the ignorance of the car owner. But being an ignorant car owner, you can use measures to protect your car if you fail to. A covert GPS tracker is a huge life saver that can help you to survive the situation. If you can't believe it, this is the evidence. Read on.

A man has turned up at Lancaster County Sheriffâ€™s Office on one Wednesday for filing a petition that his car was stolen while being parked near 134th Street and Yankee Hill Road. He was not around and was busy in his work and hence couldn't witness the crime or the culprit.  

He left the window of his 2002 Toyota Tacoma pickup truck rolled down and the key still in the ignition, paving the way for the criminal out of his own ignorance. He was, however, one step ahead of the criminal thanks to the fact that his keychain had a GPS-enabled small tracker, which allowed deputies to estimate the truck's whereabouts somewhere around 25th and R Streets. 

The truck was found shortly after deputies arrived on the scene and executed a traffic stop near 23rd and U Streets. An adult male, 62 years old, was driving the truck. He was taken into custody and later charged with theft of property and driving while having a suspended licence.
